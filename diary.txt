COMP2041

Tuesday 16th March - 1900 - 2030
	reading the spec, watch lecture tutorial. played a little with 2041 girtin terminal. trying to understand where to ebgin and how to structure the assignemnt. 

Wednesday  17th March - 0800 - 1300
	began working on subset0 . girt-init was simple enough and had a basic girt add working by end of the day . committed to gitlab. had to re-read the spec and play around with 2041 girt to understnad what was happening with girt-add and what happens when you dont add a file etc,

Thursday 18th March - 1400 - 1800
	managed to pass most of the girt-add autotests. need to work on comparing the the indexed file and the file i am looking to add per the lecture? . more research required . managed to get the issue of invalid filenames sorted as wel

Wednesday 24th March 0900 - 1030
	Received an email from Andrew stating we were allowed to submit our own work again. Will need to go back and make a note in each file that that is what I have done. Previous attempt wasnt the best so I need to continue working through subset 1 and hope to get that finished off later this week as well as test suite.

	ive fucked up. my girt show doesnt work correctly. going to need to fix it. it passes the autotests but it doesnt work with the girt-rm tasks. might need to tear down and start agai

	spent this morning trying to re-write girt-show . what a waste of time. couldnt get it working for subset0_9 the girt-show 1:b 'hello world' becuase b was not committed to commit file 1 and my code was saying error file not found and the autotest didnt like that so when i changed things around it would throw errors for other things. so im just gonna leave my girt-show using last years code since it passes more autotests. may still need to re-work it in order to get girt-rm to work. tired unimpresses. logging off.

	i think the problem is now with the girt-commit. too long and a naive apprach. might need to restructure my girt repo to have moe than just an index and a commits folder. I am hopeing with the introduction of a third or fourth folder it will be easier to keep track of file changes and make them display with girt-show or not. more thinking and research to do

	went to the help session. discovered that the problems I have been facing the last few days had nothing to do with my girt-show but rather my girt-commit. I was deleting the file from the index once committed which was causing the problem with girt-show becuase the file was not in a specific commit folder and not in the index, printing an error message and failing autotest. Removed the rm from my girt-commit. Now facing problems with the commit -a and girt-show again. will need to diagnose. for whatever reason it wont cat my filesanymore?? strange.

	Completed all subsets.... april fools. For the girt-commit -a , i was trying to re-write the entire "function/feature" instead I should have just been calling girt-add since that is the same functionality that is required to pass the autotests. after weeks of going round and round in circles I am now redy to go back to working on girt-rm.... wooooo
