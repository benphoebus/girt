COMP2041

Tuesday 16th March - 1900 - 2030
	reading the spec, watch lecture tutorial. played a little with 2041 girtin terminal. trying to understand where to ebgin and how to structure the assignemnt. 

Wednesday  17th March - 0800 - 1300
	began working on subset0 . girt-init was simple enough and had a basic girt add working by end of the day . committed to gitlab. had to re-read the spec and play around with 2041 girt to understnad what was happening with girt-add and what happens when you dont add a file etc,

Thursday 18th March - 1400 - 1800
	managed to pass most of the girt-add autotests. need to work on comparing the the indexed file and the file i am looking to add per the lecture? . more research required . managed to get the issue of invalid filenames sorted as wel

Wednesday 24th March
	Received an email from Andrew stating we were allowed to submit our own work again. Will need to go back and make a note in each file that that is what I have done. Previous attempt wasnt the best so I need to continue working through subset 1 and hope to get that finished off later this week as well as test suite.
