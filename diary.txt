COMP2041

Tuesday 16th March - 1900 - 2030
	reading the spec, watch lecture tutorial. played a little with 2041 girtin terminal. trying to understand where to ebgin and how to structure the assignemnt. 

Wednesday  17th March - 0800 - 1300
	began working on subset0 . girt-init was simple enough and had a basic girt add working by end of the day . committed to gitlab. had to re-read the spec and play around with 2041 girt to understnad what was happening with girt-add and what happens when you dont add a file etc,

Thursday 18th March - 1400 - 1800
	managed to pass most of the girt-add autotests. need to work on comparing the the indexed file and the file i am looking to add per the lecture? . more research required . managed to get the issue of invalid filenames sorted as well
